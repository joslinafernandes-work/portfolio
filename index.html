          Hi! I’m Joslina, a former Training & Implementation Consultant who genuinely enjoys making things easier to understand. My background is in tech training and implementation, which means I’ve spent a lot of time helping people learn how to use complex software without feeling overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          While my professional journey is still growing, I’ve had hands-on experience creating user guides, tutorials, and training materials that support both users and teams. I care deeply about clarity, empathy, and making content that feels approachable.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Currently, I’m on a career break to focus on parenting, and I’m now I'm ready and excited to dive back into the professional world. I’m particularly interested in remote opportunities that allow me to balance work with family life.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Between my parenting adventures, you’ll often find me enjoying art and craft projects, exploring new tech, or unwinding with a warm cup of coffee.
        </p>
